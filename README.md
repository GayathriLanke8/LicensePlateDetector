# License Plate Detector🥸
This project uses [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR), and a [YOLO (Ultralytics)](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) object detection model from Ultralytics to detect vehicle license plates from images or video frames.
Once a license plate is detected, the project extracts the alphanumeric license number using OCR and identifies the Indian state/region of registration based on the first two characters of the plate (e.g., AP → Andhra Pradesh).

- OpenCV — Computer vision library for image processing
- Matplotlib — Plotting and visualization library
- EasyOCR — Optical character recognition tool  
- YOLO (Ultralytics) — Object detection model
